## Open Source Checklist

### Code

___ [Choose](http://choosealicense.com/) a license
- Without a license, people won't or can't use your code

___ [Create repository](https://github.com/new)

___ Include CONTRIBUTORS.md in repository
- Encourages people to contribute and acts as a guideline for contribution

___ Include README.md with general information about the repository
- Even if a website exists for the codebase, a quick summary prevents the user from needing to click another link

___ Include or reference a [style guide](https://github.com/cbmi/style-guides)
- This should be mentioned in the CONTRIBUTORS.md and optionally in the README.md

___ Define a set of consistent [issue labels](https://github.com/cbmi/style-guides/blob/master/git.md#issue-labels)
- This promotes clarity and consistency when triaging issues

___ Integrate with [Travis-CI](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/) for continuous integration/testing of your code base

___ Integrate with [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/docs) (which integrates with Travis-CI) for code coverage stats


### Documentation

___ [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for user and technical docs
- To make using Jekyll a tad easier for documentation, check out [jekyll-docs-template](http://bruth.github.io/jekyll-docs-template/)
- There are alternatives for hosting auto-generated technical docs such as [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org)

___ _(optional)_ [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/blog/774-git-powered-wikis-improved) for community supplied information or extensions
- See [Backbone's wiki](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki) for example pages

### Community

___ [Create](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!creategroup) a Google Group or something
- For general discussion, questions, support, etc.
- Provides a low barrier for getting people aware of what's happening in the project without needing to have a GitHub account

___ _(optional)_ [Create](https://plus.google.com/communities) a Google+ community
- More of a friendly and social format for the project as suppose to a mailing list

___ _(optional)_ [Create](https://twitter.com/signup) a Twitter account
