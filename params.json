{"name":"Open Source Checklist","tagline":"CBMi's Open Source Checklist","body":"### Code\r\n\r\n- [Choose](http://choosealicense.com/) a license\r\n    - Without a license, people won't or can't use your code\r\n- [Create repository](https://github.com/new)\r\n- Include CONTRIBUTORS.md in repository\r\n    - Encourages people to contribute and acts as a guideline for contribution\r\n- Include README.md with general information about the repository\r\n    - Even if a website exists for the codebase, a quick summary prevents the user from needing to click another link\r\n- Include or reference a [style guide](https://github.com/cbmi/style-guides)\r\n    - This should be mentioned in the CONTRIBUTORS.md and optionally in the README.md\r\n- Define a set of consistent [issue labels](https://github.com/cbmi/style-guides/blob/master/git.md#issue-labels)\r\n    - This promotes clarity and consistency when triaging issues\r\n- Integrate with [Travis-CI](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/) for continuous integration/testing of your code base\r\n- Integrate with [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/docs) (which integrates with Travis-CI) for code coverage stats\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for user and technical docs\r\n    - To make using Jekyll a tad easier for documentation, check out [jekyll-docs-template](http://bruth.github.io/jekyll-docs-template/)\r\n    - There are alternatives for hosting auto-generated technical docs such as [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org)\r\n- _(optional)_ [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/blog/774-git-powered-wikis-improved) for community supplied information or extensions\r\n    - See [Backbone's wiki](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki) for example pages\r\n    - Here is [wiki template](https://github.com/bruth/oss-community-wiki/wiki) which includes most of the needed pages for building a community\r\n- Dedicate a site or series of pages to **cookbook-style** code recipes\r\n    - Recipes should follow the tried and true O'Reilly [problem/solution/discussion format](http://oreillynet.com/images/cookbooks/spread.gif)\r\n    - This acts as a _code examples FAQ_ which lowers the barrier for people to learn the APIs\r\n    - Create an editable wiki page or thread on Google Groups to encourage user-submitted recipes. If these are the dedicated pages, ensure the recipes are reviewed and attribute is provided when they are moved.\r\n        - Send an email thanking the user who submitted with a link to the new location of the recipe\r\n\r\n\r\n### Community\r\n\r\n- Create tickets that are simple to implement/fix to encourage people to contribute (even if it takes longer to write up the ticket than to implement)\r\n    - This lowers the barrier to get someone _in the code_. They will become comfortable navigating the code which increases their likelihood to contribute.\r\n- [Create](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!creategroup) a Google Group or something\r\n    - For general discussion, questions, support, etc.\r\n    - Provides a low barrier for getting people aware of what's happening in the project without needing to have a GitHub account\r\n- _(optional)_ [Create](https://plus.google.com/communities) a Google+ community\r\n    - More of a friendly and social format for the project as suppose to a mailing list\r\n- _(optional)_ [Create](https://twitter.com/signup) a Twitter account\r\n    - Short notifications such as new releases, community events, hackathons, etc.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
